      <h1>Hackingtons Online</h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>
          Hackingtons has taken it's Silicon Valley based, in-class coding program for kids and made it available to the rest of the world through Hackingtons Online. Hackingtons Online consists of all of the same project based instruction that is available for the in-class students but in a system that online learners can access.
        </p>

        <h2>We are a Home School Vendor</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Visions in Education</li>
          <li>Inspire Charter Schools</li>
          <li>Connecting Waters Charter School</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Teach</h2>
        <p>At Hackingtons we focus on web based learning, teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are very visual languages that allow the students to instantly see the changes they are making. They are also the foundation for everything that is built on the web. JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the web offering the students a quick way to add interactivity to their site and powerful enough to add pro-level features. We even use JavaScript to teach video game development, building games they can share with their friends. JavaScript is very similar to Python and Java. Most students can easily transfer their coding skills between different languages.</p>

        <h2>Project Based Learning </h2>
          <p> 
            We use a unique process for teaching, we do not just teach the theory of coding but rather we show the students exactly how to use what they are learning through building projects. Each video or video series is a complete project. The students learn what each piece does as they build their own version of the illustrative lesson. The videos walk the students through a generic project, like building a theme park website, and allow the students to customize it using their own creativity. The completion of each of these projects culminates in a belt "test". Basically it is a larger project that allows the students to show off what they have learned before they can advance to the more difficult projects in the next belt.
          </p>

          <h2>Posting Projects</h2>
          <p>By structuring the lessons to be project based the students get to have a sense of accomplishment after completing each video. This sense of pride in their work extends when they post their website or game to the Hackingtons Showcase. This is a page where all of the student's work lives. It gives them a way to show off what they have built to hundreds of other students. They can even receive votes from others who like their work. Yes they are posting live, published websites and games that can be linked and shared around the world with family and friends. At the end of day one they will have their work displayed on the showcase.</p>

          <h2>Asking Questions</h2>
          <p>Building along with the lessons is usually pretty straight forward, but even I spell my own name wrong and don't realize it sometimes. As a distance learning student the hardest part of learning something new is what happens when they get stuck. In the class room a teacher is always available and we have tried very hard to bring that same experience to Hackingtons Online. The question forum is a place for the students to ask direct questions by including their code. We can then take a look at the code they wrote and help them out. This questions forum is always being looked at by one of our many teachers. To expand further on that, we offer a live stream 3 days a week that the students can use to talk directly to a teacher and get the cooperative classroom experience. They can ask their questions directly in the chat or include a link to their code in the questions forum. This allows them to ask follow up questions and talk constructively about their project.</p>

          <h2>System Requirements</h2>
          <p>At Hackingtons we teach web development and thus our tools should be web based. As such the only requirement is a computer that runs Google Chrome. Both Mac and Windows operating systems work with our curriculum. The courses are taught using Mac OSX so some of the short cut key commands may be different but those are not necessary to complete any of the projects. Google Chrome is the most widely accepted browser among developers and is the most stable when it comes to the tools that we use.</p>

          <h2>Signing Up</h2>
          <p>To sign up head over to

This gives you access to everything on the site, all courses, all projects, the ability to post to the showcase, access to Hackingtons Live, and the questions forum. We are currently offering a 7 day free trial so your student can try it out without worry. I hope to see you online.</p>

          <h2>Happy Coding!</h2>
