Hackingtons teaches professional-level coding skills to kids. We also encourage positive interaction between classmates. And most importantly, we launch our code to the web, for millions to see.

Our program is designed for all levels of students, from beginner to advanced. Our curriculum is project-based and everyone progresses at their own speed.

Regardless of where you attend Hackingtons classes, your child is part of our community. We host YouTube Live lessons three times per week, and post a 'Best of Hackingtons' every week highlighting student projects.
