Tips and tricks to keep yourself and your kids safe when browsing the web. We build websites, we know how they work and can show you what to avoid or what to proactively do to stay safe online. 

## How to Stay Safe Online
-----

### Tip #1: Never Use Your Real Full Name 
Just like talking to strangers you would never use your real name online. By using your real name you are challenging the millions of people online to find out every piece of information they can about you, your REAL information. Not that JimmyJon123 has a really cool Scratch account but that James Johnson lives at 1234 JavaScript lane. 

There are so many people out there that can find out almost everything about you with very little information. If your account gets hacked, no worries you can make a new one. If someone hacks into your house it will be very expensive to get a new one.

Be safe, protect your name.

### Tip #2: Don't Just Click Random Things!
Websites are full of brilliant people making extremely useful things. Some do it for free but those who want to get paid for their hard work need to take in money on their site. Instead of asking you for money directly, no you can't just insert it into the disk drive, they serve ads. Some of those brilliant people we were talking about earlier make those ads. They make the ads look exactly like that download link you are supposed to click. But don't click it! So many of those ads are advertising malware or other harmful viruses. If a site has a bunch of ads that all say download here or make it look like they are part of the site, that web page should probably be off limits all together. 

Know what you are clicking before your click it.

### Tip #3: No Website Ever Needs to Know Your Password
If you get an official looking email that is asking for your password it is a scam. The web developers that run and build the site have access to your passwords stored in their database, that only they can see. They never need to ask you for your password. If they can't access it they will reset it for you and send you a link to change your password next time you log in. 

Your password is like the key to your house, don't go handing it out to anyone.

### Tip #4: Know the Sites You Visit
The web is a beautiful place that has a seemingly infinite number of places to visit. However, there are some out there that are up to no good. Some sites can be trusted, big names and dot coms are usually safe. If you go trolling for a free copy of that song you love so much you will inevitably end up some place you will not like. Covered in malware and ads the site spells scam. Know the sites that you are visiting and if it doesn't sound familiar, stay away. 

When in doubt search up the name of the site and the word scam or virus in the same search and see what comes up.

### Tip #5: Surf the Web with an Adult
Life experience is a magical thing that often comes when we mess up, and adults have been around long enough to know about messing up, a lot. If you are still to young to navigate a busy mall by yourself then wandering around the internet should be done with an adult present as well. No they don't have to watch your every move, and parents you don't need to hover over them. Just keep them within ear or eye shot to stop something drastic from happening. 

The "Hey what is this?" is much better to hear than the "Ummm I can't get it to turn on" phrase.

# Happy Coding!
